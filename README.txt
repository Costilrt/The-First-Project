Team Project: Exploring Netflix Shows and Movies

Matthew Hill, Rolly Costillas, Derek Mast, Chang Woon Jang

Project Description/Outline
By looking at several datasets from kaggle and omdbapi from 2019 to March 2022, we can see changes in views tastes over the last four years. We will be looking at types of show, genre and release dates to find patterns in the most successful Netflix shows and movies. With the help of APIâ€™s we can get more information out of our database including genre and metacritic scores. We are going to visualize our analysis by graphs and plots including bar, scatter, line, etc. Statistical analysis methods will be used to describe and summarize our findings and possibly provide us with a confidence level of predictions.
